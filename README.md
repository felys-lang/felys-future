# Felys Future

Immature thoughts about Felys and build some unstable components.

## Plan

Unlike the full-stack version of current Felys, the future version will have a front-end and back-end separated architecture. The former will stay in Rust, but the latter will move to C for more flexibility and better performance. Then it will bind to Rust and Python again for the interface like the CLI and REPL.

### Front-end

I am familiar with PEG, which is powerful enough, so I will stick with it.

### Back-end

Still a newbie.

### Progress

Currently reading the dragon book to get some academic knowledge in building programming language; definitely going to read some books related to JIT compiler and garbage collection.
